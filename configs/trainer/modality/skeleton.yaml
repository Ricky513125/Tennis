in_chans: 17  # 17 keypoints converted to heatmaps
# decoder_num_classes calculation:
# Formula: decoder_num_classes = in_chans * tubelet_size * patch_size^2
# For skeleton: 17 * 2 * 16^2 = 17 * 2 * 256 = 8704
# Note: This is independent of input_size, it's based on patch_size only
decoder_num_classes: 8704  # 17 * 2 * 16^2 = 8704
